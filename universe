We will never understand the universe. Because there is nothing to understand: The universe encompasses everything. All existence and non-existence and everything beyond. Nothing escapes the universe, not even nothing. There is nothing outside the universe and even this non-existence of non-existence exists in the universe.

The universe is universal and infinite.

Everything is part of the universe. We are a part of the universe, each of us, and the universe is in everything that exists and in everything that does not exist. 

So it is impossible to distinguish between inside and outside the universe because there is no exterior: 
the universe includes everything, even nothing
