Hi, I'm Valentin 

I'm interested in cryptography and open-source projects. But at the moment I am particularly working with network technology.

We have to fight for a fair and open internet. For this purpose I am a member of the Internet Society, the International Association for Cryptologic Research and a donor of the EFF.
