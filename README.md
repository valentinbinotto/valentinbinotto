The Internet is inherently anarchistic

The internet is the purest expression of the desire for freedom,
the desire for exchange and knowledge,
the purest expression of anarchism
```

We have to fight for a fair and open internet. Because the Internet connects us humans, helps us to exchange thoughts and perhaps also gives us a purpose in life: the interaction, the communication with others. 
I believe the Internet is inherently anarchistic. However, large profit-seeking platforms are trying to exploit the Internet for their own benefit. We have to understand how the Internet works and actively shape the Internet ourselves and we will exchange information directly again, simply for the sake of communication and experience and not for the greed of a large corporation.
