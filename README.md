From the perspective of the infinite and inexplicable universe, do we, all living beings on this earth, really matter?
I don't think so.

Hi, I'm Valentin 

I'm interested in networking, cryptography and open-source projects.

We have to fight for a fair and open internet. Because the Internet connects us humans, helps us to exchange thoughts and perhaps also gives us a purpose in life: the interaction, the communication with all other people. 
I believe the Internet is inherently anarchistic. However, large profit-seeking platforms do not have our best interests at heart and are trying to exploit the Internet for their own benefit. But if we understand how the Internet works, in fact actively shape the Internet ourselves, these profiteers will become less influential and we humans will increasingly exchange information directly again, simply for the sake of communication and experience and not for the greed of a large corporation.

For this purpose I am a member of the Internet Society, the International Association for Cryptologic Research and a donor of the EFF.
